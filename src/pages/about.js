    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>Short Version</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a polyglot web developer. Current interests include Elixir/Erlang,
      Rust, Haskell, .NET (F#/C#), and DevOps when necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have limited availability for contract projects and am currently not
      looking for new full-time opportunities. Send me an email if you'd like to
      discuss a project with me.
    </p>

    <h2>Long Version</h2>

    <p>
      I am a polyglot developer striving to build performant and scalable
      applications and libraries targeted for the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have building building applications for the web since 2003, when I was
      enrolled in a "Web Programming" class in high school. The course was
      supposed to cover only HTML and CSS, but myself and a few others were
      offered to learn PHP instead because of our quick grasp of the basics.
      I've been tinkering with and learning web programming on my own ever
      since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally, I have developed for a variety of companies ranging from
      individuals and startups to agencies and financial institutions in a
      variety of programming languages, including C# and VB.NET, PHP, and
      Elixir.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current passions include improving developer efficiency and experience,
      functional programming (in the form of Elixir, Erlang, F#, and Haskell),
      and writing resilient code (whether by architecture choice, testing, or
      leveraging language/platform traits).
