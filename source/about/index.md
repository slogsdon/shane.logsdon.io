## Short Version

I'm a polyglot web developer. Current interests include Elixir/Erlang, Rust, Haskell, .NET (F#/C#), and DevOps when necessary.

I have limited availability for contract projects and am currently not looking for new full-time opportunities. Send me an email if you'd like to discuss a project with me.

## Long Version

I am a polyglot developer striving to build performant and scalable applications and libraries targeted for the web.

I have building building applications for the web since 2003, when I was enrolled in a "Web Programming" class in high school. The course was supposed to cover only HTML and CSS, but myself and a few others were offered to learn PHP instead because of our quick grasp of the basics. I've been tinkering with and learning web programming on my own ever since.

Professionally, I have developed for a variety of companies ranging from individuals and startups to agencies and financial institutions in a variety of programming languages, including C# and VB.NET, PHP, and Elixir.

My current passions include improving developer efficiency and experience, functional programming (in the form of Elixir, Erlang, F#, and Haskell), and writing resilient code (whether by architecture choice, testing, or leveraging language/platform traits).
